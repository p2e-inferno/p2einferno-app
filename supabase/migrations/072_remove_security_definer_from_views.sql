-- Remove SECURITY DEFINER from views to prevent privilege escalation
-- Per Supabase advisory: Security Definer views can bypass RLS and cause unauthorized access
-- Affected: all_applications_view, user_applications_view

-- Drop and recreate views WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
-- This ensures views run with the permissions of the calling user, not the view creator
