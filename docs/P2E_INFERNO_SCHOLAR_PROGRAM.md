P2E Inferno Scholar ProgramInfernal Sparks Bootcamp – Web3Onboarding CurriculumProgram Duration: 4 WeeksTarget Audience: Beginners and Web3 NovicesPrerequisites: Computer literacy, internet access, and a willingness tolearn.Program OverviewThis curriculum is designed to take a participant from zero knowledgeto a functional Web3 citizen. It utilizes a "learn-by-doing" methodology,where theoretical concepts are immediately reinforced by on-chainactions.Pedagogical FrameworkQuests: Structured practical tasks that advance participantcompetency. They must be executed to progress.Proof of Work: Verifiable evidence (transaction hashes, links,screenshots) demonstrating milestone completionRewards: DG tokens distributed upon successful verification ofdeliverablesSecurity FoundationDigital asset management requires vigilant security practices. Thefollowing principles apply throughout this program:
● Private Key Protection: Never disclose your seed phrase or privatekeys to any person or service, including program administrators orsupport personnel.● Wallet Segregation: Maintain separate wallets for experimentationand asset storage. Use a dedicated testing wallet for protocolinteractions and reserve a secure cold wallet for long-termholdings.● Verification Protocol: Authenticate all URLs before connectingyour wallet. Unsolicited direct messages offering technicalsupport or requesting software downloads are fraudulent withoutexception.Week 1: Foundations – Identity & Web3 SocialTime Commitment: Approximately 8 HoursModule SummaryThis module establishes participants' onchain presence through thecreation of secure, self-custodial wallets and decentralized socialidentities. Learners will understand the architectural distinctionbetween Ethereum's base layer and Layer 2 scaling solutions whileestablishing their foundational Web3 identity stack.Learning Objectives● Distinguish between Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1) and Layer 2rollup networks (eg, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.)● Understand the security implications of self-custody versuscentralized exchanges● Implement secure wallet backup procedures and recognizecommon attack vectors● Understand the utility of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) andhuman-readable addresses
Key ConceptsSelf-Custody FundamentalsSelf-custody represents the cornerstone of Web3 participation. Unliketraditional financial systems, where institutions control account access,self-custody places complete control—and responsibility—in the handsof the individual. Your private keys function as the sole authority overyour digital assets. This autonomy eliminates institutional gatekeepersbut introduces personal security obligations.Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)Web3 authentication operates fundamentally differently from Web2credential systems. Rather than creating username-passwordcombinations for each service, your wallet serves as a universalauthentication mechanism. This cryptographic signature-basedapproach eliminates password databases and reduces identityfragmentation while placing you in control of your authenticationcredentials.Layer 2 Scaling SolutionsEthereum's base layer (Layer 1) prioritizes security and decentralizationbut faces throughput limitations that result in elevated transactioncosts. Layer 2 networks such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum executetransactions off the main chain while inheriting Ethereum's securityguarantees through periodic settlement. This architecture reducestransaction costs by factors of 10-100x while maintaining securityproperties, making them ideal environments for learning andexperimentation.Practical Tasks (Quests)Quest 1.1: Secure Wallet EstablishmentInstall a self-custody wallet application (recommended options includeRainbow, MetaMask, or Coinbase Wallet). During the setup process, youwill receive a seed phrase—typically 12 or 24 words—that serves as themaster key to your wallet.Security Protocol: Record your seed phrase on physical paper using apen or pencil. Store this paper in a secure location separate from yourcomputer. Never photograph your seed phrase, store it in cloud
services, or enter it into any application except when recovering yourwallet on a new device. Phishing attacks frequently impersonate walletsupport services requesting seed phrases—legitimate services neverrequest this information.Quest 1.2: Human-Readable Identity CreationAcquire a Base Name through the Base Name Service. This namingsystem functions similarly to ENS but operates on the Base Layer 2network, providing affordable human-readable addresses. Your BaseName (e.g., yourname.base.eth) creates a memorable identity thatresolves to your hexadecimal wallet address, improving usability whensharing payment information or establishing your onchain identity.Quest 1.3: Decentralized Content Platform OnboardingCreate a profile on Zora, a decentralized content creation anddistribution platform. Publish your inaugural content piece—this couldbe text, an image, or multimedia content. This action establishes yourpresence on a creator-owned platform where content and relationshipsexist independently of centralized platform control.Quest 1.4: Decentralized Social Network (optional)Register for Farcaster using the Warpcast client application.Publish your first "cast" (the Farcaster equivalent of a post or tweet).Farcaster represents a protocol-level approach to social networkingwhere your identity and social graph are portable across multiple clientapplications, preventing platform lock-in.Expected OutcomesParticipants completing Week 1 will demonstrate:● Operational proficiency with self-custody wallet software● Establishment of human-readable onchain identity via BaseName Service● Active presence on decentralized content and social platforms● Understanding of seed phrase security and proper backupprocedures● Ability to distinguish between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networkcontexts
Proof of Work (Milestone 1)Submit the following verification materials:● Basescan link demonstrating your Base Name registrationtransaction and its association with your wallet address● Direct link to your Zora profile and your first published content● (Optional) Link to your Warpcast profile● (Optional) Link to your first castReward: Up to 12,000 DGDistribution:● 3000 DG for completing the Basename task.● 3000 DG for completing the Zora task.● 3000 DG for completing the Warpcast task.● 3,000 DG for completing your first cast task.Week 2: Interaction – Decentralized Financeand Governance ParticipationTime Commitment: 8 HoursModule SummaryThis module transitions participants from passive identity holders toactive protocol participants. Learners will execute transactions on adecentralized exchange and engage with Decentralized AutonomousOrganization (DAO) governance structures, understanding both thetechnical and the social coordination mechanisms that define Web3ecosystems.Learning Objectives● Basic understanding of the operational mechanics of automatedmarket maker (AMM) decentralized exchanges● Understand DAO organizational structures and governance tokenfunctionality● Analyze the roles of token delegation, governors, and timelocksmart contracts.
● Distinguish between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake consensusmechanisms● Execute smart contract interaction via token swaps whileimplementing appropriate security verification procedures.Key ConceptsDecentralized Finance (DeFi)DeFi represents financial infrastructure implemented through smartcontracts rather than institutional intermediaries. Decentralizedexchanges, lending protocols, and derivatives markets operate throughtransparent, auditable code rather than opaque institutional processes.This architecture enables permissionless access—anyone with a walletcan participate—while introducing personal responsibility fortransaction verification and risk assessment.Consensus MechanismsBlockchain networks achieve agreement on transaction orderingthrough consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-work systems like Bitcoinrequire computational work to produce blocks, securing the networkthrough energy expenditure. Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake,where validators stake capital as collateral to propose blocks, reducingenergy consumption by approximately 99.95 percent while maintainingsecurity through economic incentives.DAO Treasury ManagementDecentralized Autonomous Organizations coordinate resourcesthrough transparent, onchain governance. Community treasuries holdcollective assets, with allocation decisions made through proposal andvoting processes. Token holders can vote directly or delegate theirvoting power to representatives who participate actively in governance.Governor contracts enforce proposal execution through timelockdelays, providing the community time to respond to contentiousdecisions.
Practical Tasks (Quests)Quest 2.1: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) TransactionExecute an ETH/UP token swap using Uniswap on the Base Layer 2network. Begin with a small test amount to familiarize yourself with theinterface and transaction flow.Optional: Sell $DG for $UP token using the DG Token Vendor on BaseLayer 2 network.Security Protocol: Before approving any token swap, verify the tokencontract address using Basescan or the project's official website.Counterfeit tokens with similar names or symbols are common attackvectors. Additionally, examine the URL carefully—phishing sites createnear-identical domains (e.g., 'unisawp.com' instead of 'uniswap.org').Bookmark legitimate DeFi interfaces after verifying them throughofficial project social media accounts.When connecting your wallet, review the permissions requested.Approve only the specific transaction amount rather than unlimitedtoken allowances when possible.It's worth noting that while unlimited approvals improve conveniencefor frequent trading, they present security risks if the contract iscompromised. Applications like revoke.cash allow users to review andrevoke token approvals granted to smart contracts.Quest 2.2: Governance OnboardingJoin the Unlock Protocol DAO Discord server. Observe the governancediscussions in progress. Note the structure of proposals, the nature ofcommunity discussions, and the decision-making processes employedby the organization.
Quest 2.3: Community IntroductionIntroduce yourself in the designated introductions channel in theUnlock Protocol Discord server.Tip: Share your background, interests in Web3, and goals forparticipating in the ecosystem. This establishes your presence withinthe governance community and opens pathways for deeperparticipation.Expected OutcomesParticipants completing Week 2 will demonstrate:● Practical experience executing DeFi transactions on Layer 2networks● Understanding of token (ERC20) approval and allowanceprocedures and implications.● Active membership in a DAO community● Familiarity with governance discussions and processes● Awareness of some attack vectors in DeFi contextsProof of Work (Milestone 2)Submit the following verification materials:● Transaction hash or Basescan link confirming your Uniswap tokenswap on the Base network.● Screenshot or link to your introduction post in the Unlock ProtocolDAO Discord server (should show your Discord username and themessage timestamp).● (Optional) Transaction hash or basescan link confirming yourswap of $DG to $UP using the DG Token Vendor.Reward: Up to 11,000 DGDistribution:● 3,000 DG for a successful DeFi transaction.● 3,000 DG for Unlock Discord server introduction.● 5,000 DG for completing swapping $DG to $UP task
Week 3: Exploration – Non-Fungible Tokensand Community Coordination InfrastructureTime Commitment: 8 HoursModule SummaryThis module explores the functional applications of non-fungible tokens(NFTs) beyond digital collectibles, focusing on access controlmechanisms, community membership systems, and also dives intodecentralized coordination tools. Participants will deploy a smartcontract, understand token-gated access, and decentralizeddecision-making processes.Learning Objectives● Demonstrate how NFTs function as programmable accesscredentials● Deploy a smart contract to a Layer 2 network● Explore community coordination platforms, includingcharmverse.io and Tally.xyzKey ConceptsToken-Gating and Access ControlNFTs can function as programmable keys that grant access to digital orphysical spaces, content, or communities. Unlike traditional credentialscontrolled by centralized authorities, token-gated systems verifyownership through the blockchain state. A community can restrictDiscord channels, event access, or exclusive content to holders ofspecific NFTs, creating verifiable membership systems withoutcentralized gatekeepers or credential databases.Smart Contract DeploymentNavigate to the Unlock Protocol interface and deploy a Lock contract onBase, Optimism, or Arbitrum. This Lock contract represents amembership NFT—you define the parameters, including supply, price,and duration. This action introduces you to contract deployment
interfaces and the experience of publishing immutable code to ablockchain network.The deployment process requires a transaction fee (gas). Ensure yourwallet contains some ETH on your chosen Layer 2 network. Theinterface will estimate the cost before you confirm the transaction.Decentralized Coordination ToolsAs organizations transition from hierarchical structures to decentralizednetworks, new coordination mechanisms emerge. Platforms likecharmverse.io, tally.xyz, etc., help in coordinating collective action anddecision-making.Practical Tasks (Quests)Quest 3.1: Smart Contract DeploymentVisit Unlock Protocol, connect your wallet, and deploy a "Lock" NFTsmart contract on Base, Optimism, or Arbitrum.Quest 3.2: Create a checkout for Lock NFTReturn to Unlock Protocol and create a checkout for the Lock NFT youcreated in 3.1 above. This demonstrates an easy way to sellmemberships, or access to content or service, using NFTs.Expected OutcomesParticipants completing Week 3 will demonstrate:● Capability to deploy smart contracts to Layer 2 networks viaUnlock Protocol● Understanding of token-gated access control systems● Experience with decentralized governance mechanisms● Recognition of how NFTs function as programmable credentialsbeyond artProof of Work (Milestone 3)Submit the following verification materials:● Transaction hash demonstrating successful deployment of yourLock contract, visible on the appropriate block explorer (Basescan,Optimism Explorer, or Arbiscan)
● Link to checkout created for the deployed ‘Lock NFT’.Reward: 6,000 DGDistribution:● 4,000 DG for lock contract deployment.● 2,000 DG for creating a checkout for the deployed lock.Week 4: Synthesis – Knowledge ArtifactTime Commitment: 8 HoursModule SummaryThe final module focuses on knowledge synthesis and publicdemonstration of competency. Participants consolidate their learningby creating a substantial artifact that documents their Web3 journeyand articulates core concepts to broader audiences. This capstoneserves as both an assessment and a portfolio piece, demonstratingcommunication ability alongside technical competency.Learning Objectives● Synthesize technical concepts and practical experiences fromprevious modules into a coherent narrative● Articulate Web3 principles clearly.● Create professional documentation suitable for portfoliopresentation● Establish decentralized reputation credentials through HumanPassport, formerly Gitcoin Passport (optional)● Demonstrate ability to teach concepts through documentation,explanation, or demonstrationKey ConceptsProof of Knowledge Through TeachingThe most rigorous test of understanding is the ability to teach others.Creating content that explains Web3 concepts requires organizing
knowledge, identifying core principles, and translating technicalterminology into accessible language. This process reveals gaps inunderstanding while creating value for the broader community. Yourartifact serves multiple purposes: assessment of your learning,contribution to educational resources, and demonstration ofcompetency for professional opportunities.Decentralized Reputation SystemsWeb3 introduces reputation systems based on verifiable onchainactivity rather than centralized credential authorities. HumanPassportaggregates identity signals across platforms(Web2 and Web3) to createa 'humanity score' that distinguishes genuine participants fromautomated bots or sybil attackers. This reputation framework enablesfair distribution mechanisms, reduces governance attacks, and createsportable reputation independent of platform-specific follower counts orendorsements.Practical Tasks (Quests)Quest 4.1: Learning Artifact CreationCreate and publish one comprehensive artifact documenting yourWeb3 learning journey. Select the format that best suits yourcommunication strengths:Option A: Written ArticleCompose a minimum 500-word blog post detailing your experience,key learnings, and insights gained through the program. Address topicssuch as initial challenges, conceptual breakthroughs, practicalapplications of learned concepts, and recommendations for futurelearners. Publish on Medium, Mirror, Paragraph, or your personal blog.Option B: Video DocumentationProduce a 1-3 minute video walkthrough demonstrating key conceptslearned or reflecting on your learning journey. Explain a specific Web3concept, demonstrate a technical process, or document yourprogression through the program. Publish on YouTube, Drive, ordecentralized video platforms.Option C: Structured Technical ReportCreate a minimum 2-page PDF report that synthesizes technicalconcepts, documents your executed transactions with analysis, and
provides recommendations for curriculum improvement or practicalapplications of learned skills. Structure the report with clear sections,visual documentation, and professional formatting.Option D: Social Media ThreadDevelop a comprehensive Twitter/X thread or LinkedIn articledocumenting your learning progression. Structure the thread with clearprogression, incorporate visual documentation, and provide value toreaders considering similar learning paths. Minimum 8 substantiveposts with coherent narrative flow.Evaluation Criteria:Artifacts will be assessed based on depth of understandingdemonstrated, clarity of communication, originality of insights, practicalapplication of learned concepts, and value provided to potential futurelearners.Quest 4.2: Decentralized Identity Verification (Bonus)Register for Gitcoin Passport and achieve a minimum humanity score of20. This involves connecting various accounts and completingverification stamps across multiple platforms. The processdemonstrates how decentralized identity aggregates signals frommultiple sources to create a sybil-resistant reputation.Note: Some verification stamps require small transactions or platformactivity. Evaluate which stamps align with your existing presence andactivity to achieve the target score efficiently.Expected OutcomesParticipants completing Week 3 will demonstrate:● Ability to synthesize and articulate technical Web3 concepts● Competency in creating professional documentation oreducational content● Understanding of how disparate technical and social elementscompose into coherent systems● Optional: Established decentralized reputation credentialsthrough Gitcoin Passport● Portfolio-quality artifact suitable for professional presentation
